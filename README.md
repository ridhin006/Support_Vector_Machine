# Loan Default Prediction ðŸ“Š

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes a loan default dataset and builds a classification model to predict loan defaults.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `Untitled.ipynb` â†’ Main Jupyter Notebook with data analysis and model building  
- `Loan_default.csv` â†’ Dataset used in the project (ensure it's in the same directory)  
- `README.md` â†’ Project documentation  

## ðŸ“œ Dataset
The dataset **Loan_default.csv** contains customer details and loan-related features.  
Some key columns
- **Education** â†’ Highest education level of the applicant  
- **EmploymentType** â†’ Type of employment (Salaried/Self-employed)  
- **MaritalStatus** â†’ Married or single  
- **HasMortgage** â†’ Whether the applicant has a mortgage  
- **LoanPurpose** â†’ Purpose of taking the loan  
- **HasCoSigner** â†’ Whether the loan has a co-signer  
- **DefaultStatus** â†’ Target variable (1 = Default, 0 = No Default)  

## ðŸ›  Steps Performed in the Notebook
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Importing necessary libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`
   - Reading `Loan_default.csv` using `pandas`
   - Displaying dataset overview  

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Dropping irrelevant columns (`LoanID`)
   - Encoding categorical columns using `LabelEncoder`
   - Standardizing numerical features using `StandardScaler`
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets  

3. **Model Training**
   - Using `Support Vector Classifier (SVC)` from `sklearn`
   - Training the model on the dataset  

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Generating classification reports with **Precision, Recall, and F1-score**
